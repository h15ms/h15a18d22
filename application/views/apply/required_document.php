					<h3>Visa Requirements for India</h3>
					   
					<p>When travelling abroad, one is often plagued with the hurdles of Visa. Visa policy varies from country to country and the requirements and eligibility criteria are also dependent on the type of Visa one is applying for. Take for example a US Visa requires that an Indian citizen fills out different forms for different types of Visas. The Visa policy of India changes with every country and is the product of not just internal regulations but also a product of foreign policy. These administrative entry restrictions are put in place according to the respective country an Indian citizen wishes to visit. These restrictions may require Indian citizens to either avail a Visa beforehand or acquire a Visa upon arrival.</p>

					<h5>Visa Policy of India</h5>
					<p>The policy of India changes according to the country the Indian citizen wishes to visit. As o 2015, Indian citizens wishing to travel abroad would require no visa or a visa upon arrival while visiting 51 other countries with the remainder countries requiring a visa beforehand in order to travel. The required Visa again changes with the destination country. Countries like USA and UK require different Visas, so do countries like Australia. Countries in Europe require a different Visa as well. There are 51 countries that Indian citizens do not require a Visa to visit or can avail one upon arrival. These Visas are described below</p>

					<h5>No Visa Required for Indians</h5>
					<p>This is when the destination country does not require an Indian citizen to carry a Visa to visit. These countries may or may provide a permit to visit upon arrival and again changes from country to country. While most of the countries that fall into this bracket do publish some sort of permit slip upon arrival or set a maximum duration of stay there are certain countries such as Nepal or Bhutan that allow Indian citizens to roam freely and even seek employment. The visa free countries for Indians include: Bhutan, Dominica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Fiji, Grenada, Haiti, Indonesia, Jamaica, Mauritius, Micronesia, Nepal, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu.</p>

					<h5>E-Visa</h5>
					<p>E-Visa stands for electronic via and is a Visa that is applied for online. The Visa is obtained electronically after the applicant fills in the forms and makes the payment either through credit or debit card. The officers at the gates of the entry will then verify the passport through their system but travellers are advised to carry a printed copy of the E-Visa with them. The purpose of these E-Visas range from medical visits to recreational visits and even casual business visits. The applicant will require their passport to have a validity of at least 6 months from the date of issue of the visa. The procedure to fill out the e-visa forms vary from country to country and even India has opened its gates and offers E-Visas to over 113 countries. The list of countries that require Indian citizens to avail an E-Visa in order to visit are as follows:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Bahrain</li>
						<li>Cote d'lvoire</li>
						<li>Ethiopia</li>
						<li>Georgia</li>
						<li>Kenya</li>
						<li>Myanmar</li>
						<li>Rwanda</li>
						<li>Sao Tompe and Principe</li>
						<li>Sri Lanka</li>
						<li>Zambia and Zimbabwe</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h5>Visa on arrival for Indians</h5>
					<p>Certain countries require a Visa to enter but these are often issued in the destination country. Unlike a visa free entry where the tourist will receive a landing permission or slip the Visa on arrival is an actual Visa that is issued in the destination country. The Visas that are issued on arrival have clearer specifications on duration of stay and the sort of visits that can be undertaken. Fr instance Indian citizens cannot seek employment on a visa on arrival. The countries that offer Visa on arrival to Indian citizens are as follows: Bolivia, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Comoros, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Jordan, Laos, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Marshal Islands, Mauritania, Palau, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania, Thailand, Timorleste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda.</p>
